In the current year, we’ve witnessed the evolution of certain metaverse capabilities as they advance into new dimensions, specifically within the expansive realm of spatial computing. Transitioning from being consumer-centric novelties to essential enterprise tools, spatial technologies are gaining significant traction in industrial applications. Companies are increasingly prioritising digital twins, spatial simulation, augmented work instructions, and collaborative digital spaces. These applications not only enhance safety but also contribute to heightened efficiency in factories and businesses.",
